These are my solutions to some of the problems. Seriously, __don't__ look any further, unless you are __100% percent__ sure you know what you do. Spoilers are baaaad. You've been warned.

## Project what?

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer
> programming problems that will require more than just mathematical
> insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at
> elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming
> skills will be required to solve most problems.
